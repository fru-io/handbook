# Request Guidelines
A key tenant of any successful software project is communication.  If you are creating an issue or a pull request, you will have a greater chance for success by following this guide.

## What happened (or feature request)
Please explain the motivation for your request. If it is along the lines of a bug report then make sure to provide as much information as possible to troubleshoot the issue.  If it's a feature request please describe the feature clearly and with as much detail as possible.

## What you expected to happen:
If this is a feature request it should include acceptance criteria.  If it is a bug report it should describe what the expected behavior was.

## How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible):
If this is a bug report we will need everything that we can to reproduce the issue.  Try to assume that the person reading your report has zero context and needs everything explained to them!

## How will we know this is completed?
Provide clear criteria that helps us understand this has been completed.
